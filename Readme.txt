Hello,
All of my scheduling algorithms are included in this folder, with an extra MakeFile and a python script;
	
	In order to run any of the algorithms, please use the following commands ...
	1. make <filename> (no .c) 
		or gcc -g -Wall -o filename filename.c
	
	2. ./filename processes 
			Or processes-3 as it was listed on the assignments page
	
	Each of the algorithms will output a txt file with similar data to the print statements
	
	
The included python script creates graphs and orders the data in the txt files;
this is run by executing the .ipynb (via jupiter notebook) after all the output TXT's have been created
			(I did not know if you wanted the outputs to be ordered)
			

Thank you very much for checking out my assignment!
